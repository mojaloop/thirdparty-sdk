# Note: I've manually edited the `responses` section to replace all errors with a single
# `default` entry, as suggested in https://swagger.io/docs/specification/describing-responses/
# This is because each of the error responses contains the same schema.
# Doing do makes the swagger doc much more readable, especially when rendered
